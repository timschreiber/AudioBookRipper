# AudioBookRipper
Most CD ripping software is geared more toward music albums, which cases problems when you want to rip an audio book on CD. The author is considered the Artist, and each disc is considered an Album. CDDB and/or FreeDB often mess up the file metadata, and you end up with audio book tracks spread around all over your music library.

I wrote AudioBookRipper to make ripping audio books less of a pain in the ass. Simply provide the author and title of the book, and AudioBookRipper rips each disc as a single MP3, and organizes the metadata for you, so everything is in the right place and in the right order.

Note: This is something I kinda hacked together for own use. I am not a Windows Forms programmer, and there are no guarantees about this software. It's about as AS-IS as it comes.
